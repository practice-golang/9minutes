```

## Goal

Escape a vaporware


## Getting started

* Build and run

## REST API

See `requests-admin.http` and `requests-contents.http` on `vscode` with `rest-client` extension

`GET` and `POST` make me confused so, APIs are not `RESTful`

* Read, List - `GET`, `POST`
* Write - `PUT`
* Edit - `PATCH`
* DELETE - `DELETE`

See `html` files in `/static` as pages and `/templates` as templates
